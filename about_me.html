      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Shenhao Xie. <br />
        <br>
        I'm a first-year graduate student at the University of Michigan. I'm studying UX design at the School of
        Information. I have a passion about understanding people's needs and satisfying those needs by design human
        experiences.

    <div class="me_and_UX_design">
      <h2>Me and UX design</h2>
      <p>I am a sensitive person and I care a lot about other people's feelings, which is one of the reasons that I found
        myself so interested in UX design.</p>
        <br>
      <p>The other main reason is my passion for art and design. Outside study, I enjoy drawing and playing guitar. I'm
        also a big fan of cooking. My mother taught me how to cook. She is a housewife and used to do all the housework. I
        knew how tiring it was to take care of the whole family for her and I wanted to help. I learned how to cook from
        her so I can help her with the housework. Now, I enjoy cooking and I always find it exciting to try new recipes
        and create new dishes.</p>

      <h2>Problems that I care</h2>

        <li>Help people establish healthy lifestyle to avoid overweight problems and related health issues.</li>
        <li>Improving communications and bridge the gap among people of differences.</li>
